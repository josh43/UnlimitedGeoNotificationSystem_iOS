# UnlimitedGeoNotificationSystem_iOS


This is a small demo showing that it can store more than 20 locations (which is the limit that you can have CLLocation manager(I think it's this class') store at one time). I have around 55 geo locations which most of them are the states. You will be notified upon reaching them, note I use the .gpx file to simulate this so it takes a long time in order to move from state to state :(. I tried speeding it up but have failed sadly. Also note it is not persistent yet! It should not take me long to make persistence but I am doing other things, I might do a very simple implementation where I just write all the data to a file, and reinsert everything on load.
